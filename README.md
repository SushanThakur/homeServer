# homeServer

This is the source code for a webserver that runs locally on my home server and is available to public through Cloudflare Tunneling.

You can visit this webpage to see the output: https://server.sushant.uk

Note: This webpage will only be accessable when my home server is online. (most of the time it won't be, this is only for testing purpose)
